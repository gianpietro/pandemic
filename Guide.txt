Program to input numbers and perform various calculations

Starting point is to have

1. structure
      this will have items to add various data items
      e.g. country name, total cases, total deaths
      I will start with these items and expand
      
2. linked list
      The structure will be an array as it will have
      a number of countries data.
      I want to then have this array as a linked list
      and will need to work on the various processes
      such as add, delete, amend etc


Once I have the starting point set up will want to look
at saving the data to a file so that the program can
save and retrieve from the file.

3. retrieve and save to file


STAGE 1 LETS START - COMPLETED
 pandemic.c
 the structure
 1. country
 2. total cases
 3. total deaths
 4. pointer to next structure in list
 5. store data in file and read file, manually create file for now


STAGE 2 VIEW DATA - COMPLETED
  Need to include a date value for each row in the data

STAGE 3 SEARCH - COMPLETED 
  A country search function which will sort data by date order
  and store values recdate, tcase.
  This will be used to plot graph with gnuplot.
   

STAGE 4 GITHUB - COMPLETED
  Tidy up pandemic.c file and them add repository in github
  before continuing to next stage.


STAGE 5 MAKEFILE - COMPLETED
  Look at seperating the functions into library files
  This will require a header file 
  Use makefile to compile project


STAGE 6 OTHER CASE - COMPLETED
  Need to add tdeaths array. Could use tcases functions and depending on user
  input e.g. 1 = tcase 2 = tdeaths, may be able to reuse the
  same functions already built.

  
STAGE 7 DATA COLLECTION - COMPLETED
  Review method of data colletion.
  Need to tidy up the country name , can look at using csv file 
  and how spaces are applied in country name or just manually  
  tidy up name using underscore e.g south_korea. I would make  
  all names lowercase.


STAGE 8 - COMPLETED
 Load data from program, each day file save 
 user enters file name to load.
 Thinking of file name to be date e.g. 10520 so when
 user enters name if already updated will get warning
 Could use a file to store file name uploaded.

  Each day will collect file of country listing need to append this
  to a master file. Thinking of doing this in the program. For example
  todaysFile.txt append to masterFile.txt. Will probably have prompt
  to enter file name to append e.g. 010520.txt being 1st May data.

STAGE 9 GTK
Could use glade and gtk for UI

STAGE 10 - COMPLETED
Plot graph of a selected number of countries against each other.
One method would be to create multiple datafiles, one for each country
e.g. country1.txt, country2.txt, country3.txt etc
Can then use a loop to upload each data file:

plot for [i=1:2] 'country'.i.'.txt' using 1:2:xtic(1) with lines

This is 2 column data file, date and number of cases


STAGE 11 -COMPLETED
Look at changing the date format to yyyymmdd, this should make it easier when I will
look into sorting by date order.
e.g. 20200101, 20200102, 20200103......20200131
     20200201, 20200202, 20200203......20200228
     .....
     20201201, 20201202, 20201203......20201231
Tested with new datafile and can now use above date format and shellsort on date.
This is a great and simple fix, really happy with this.


STAGE 12
look at smooth lines in the plot
plot "DATA" smooth csplines,
other options:
bezier, sbezier, csplines, acsplines

Could have a menu option to allow user to select which graph type view would like.
This would be parameter to sent to plot graph functions.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30580471/smooth-peaks-in-gnuplot
Smoothing with acsplines draws an approximating cubic spline, which doesn't go through your original data points.
A better approach could be to use cubic splines smooth csplines, which go through all data points but may show overshoots for sharp peaks.
The probably best solution in your case is to use monotonic cubic splines, smooth mcsplines, which maintain the monotonicity and convexity of the original data points


STAGE 13
Country population and rate of infection. Could have a seperate file with country and population. Use this to calculation rate of infection and plot graph. 
1. datafile with country and population
2. upload this data to a struct.
3. then need an array of country and the number of cases
      can use the latest value of new cases
      or can enter a date and use the number of cases at that date
4. will need to match the datafile country with the case number array
   and calculate the percentage of infected people. This will be
   percent of pop infected = number of cases / population * 100
   Then need to have another array with country and infected percentage (2 columns)
5. Use this to plot a histogram, could be of all countries or user
   enters a rate value and will plot rate value or greater
